# 10 tips to help you effectively communicate


### 1. Be an engaged listener! 
Step one to being heard is listening when you need to! Constantly checking your phone or the clock is distracting and indicates your focus is elsewhere.

### 2. Pay attention to non verbal signals
Enhance your conversations with open body language-- arms crossed, standing with an open stance or sitting at the edge of your seat, maintaining eye contact, etc.

### 3. Assert yourself!
Value yourself and your opinions-- your opinions are as important as anyone else's!

### 4. Recognize the other peron's situations or feelings
Be empathetic and convey sensitivity to the situation.  If the other person has a busy schedule, acknowledge that they are taking the time out of their schedule to talk with you.  Making them feel appreciated will go a long way in trying to get what you want.

### 5. Be simple and straightforward
Don't dance around the topic! Know what the goal of the conversation is and get to the point.

### 6. Use accurate, neutral descriptions
Try to refrain from using judgemental language.  Give examples and paint a picture.

### 7. Present potential, practical solutions but be flexible to hear other options.
It's helpful for the other person to know what you are hoping to achieve but don't always expect to get exactly what you want.  Be willing to compromise so that everyone leaves satisfied. 

### 8. Find the time and place
Schedule a meeting if the person you are talking to has a busy schedule to ensure you have some dedicated time for your conversation.  This also gives you the opportunity to plan what you want to say beforehand.  Get a conference room or private space for your conversation so that there are no other distractions.
 
### 9. Determine what method of communication would be received best
Not only is there a time and place for everything, but there is also an ideal means for how to start conversations based on the person you are talking to.  Whether it's face to face or via email, think about the person you are talking to and what they would be most receptive to.

### 10. Don't wait to bring up your concerns!
If a problem pops up, be sure to address it proactively.  This will give you room and time to brainstorm and work towards a solution.
