# Find the right words

Before diving in to your difficult conversations, it's important to take the time to think about what you are going to say.  

### I feel...
Open up with why this concern is important to you! Talk about how it impacts your day to day life and productivity.  By presenting it from your perspective, it will show the person you are talking to that you don't blame them for the concern but rather that you are looking to come to a solution together.

### I understand...
Acknowledge the other person.  The other person will be more likely to listen to you if you explain that you understand their side of it.  Be wary to not tie acknowledgement with agreement.  

## How to begin
Here are some conversation starters to get the ball rolling on your difficult conversations:
- I have something I’d like to discuss with you that I think will help us work together more effectively.
- I’d like to talk about ____________ with you, but first I’d like to get your point of view.
- I need your help with what just happened. Do you have a few minutes to talk?
- I need your help with something. Can we talk about it (soon)? If the person says, “Sure, let me get back to you,” follow up with him.
- I think we have different perceptions about _____________________. I’d like to hear your thinking on this.
- I’d like to talk about ___________________. I think we may have different ideas about how to _____________________.
- I’d like to see if we might reach a better understanding about ___________. I really want to hear your feelings about this and share my perspective as well.
